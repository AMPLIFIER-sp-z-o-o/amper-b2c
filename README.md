## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

To run the app in the recommended configuration, you will need the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) (for Python)
- [node and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) (for JavaScript)

On Windows, you will also need to install `make`, which you can do by
[following these instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57042516/8207).

### Initial setup

Run the following command to initialize your application:

```bash
make init
```

This will:

- Build and run your Postgres database
- Build and run your Redis database
- Run your database migrations
- Install front end dependencies

Then you can start the app:

```bash
make dev
```

This will run your Django server and build and run your front end (JavaScript and CSS) pipeline.

Your app should now be running! You can open it at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/).

## Using the Makefile

You can run `make` to see other helper functions, and you can view the source
of the file in case you need to run any specific commands.

## Installation - Native

You can also install/run the app directly on your OS using the instructions below.

You can setup a virtual environment and install dependencies in a single command with:

```bash
uv sync
```

This will create your virtual environment in the `.venv` directory of your project root.

## Set up database

_If you are using Docker you can skip these steps._

Create a database named `amplifier`.

```
createdb amplifier
```

Create database migrations:

```
uv run manage.py makemigrations
```

Create database tables:

```
uv run manage.py migrate
```

## Running server

```bash
uv run manage.py runserver
```

## Building front-end

To build JavaScript and CSS files, first install npm packages:

```bash
npm install
```

Then build (and watch for changes locally):

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Running Celery

Celery can be used to run background tasks.

Celery requires [Redis](https://redis.io/) as a message broker, so make sure
it is installed and running.

You can run it using:

```bash
celery -A amplifier worker -l INFO --pool=solo
```

Or with celery beat (for scheduled tasks):

```bash
celery -A amplifier worker -l INFO -B --pool=solo
```

Note: Using the `solo` pool is recommended for development but not for production.

## Updating translations

**Using make:**

```bash
make translations
```

**Native:**

```bash
uv run manage.py makemessages --all --ignore node_modules --ignore .venv
uv run manage.py makemessages -d djangojs --all --ignore node_modules --ignore .venv
uv run manage.py compilemessages --ignore .venv
```

## Google Authentication Setup

To setup Google Authentication, follow the [instructions here](https://docs.allauth.org/en/latest/socialaccount/providers/google.html).

## Twitter Authentication Setup

To setup Twitter Authentication, follow the [instructions here](https://docs.allauth.org/en/latest/socialaccount/providers/twitter_oauth2.html).

## Installing Git commit hooks

To install the Git commit hooks run the following:

```shell
uv run pre-commit install --install-hooks
```

Once these are installed they will be run on every commit.

## Running Tests

To run tests:

**Using make:**

```bash
make test
```

**Native:**

```bash
uv run manage.py test
```

Or to test a specific app/module:

**Using make:**

```bash
make test ARGS='apps.web.tests.test_basic_views --keepdb'
```

**Native:**

```bash
uv run manage.py test apps.web.tests.test_basic_views --keepdb
```

On Linux-based systems you can watch for changes using the following:

```bash
find . -name '*.py' | entr uv run manage.py test apps.web.tests.test_basic_views
```

## Warehouse Stock Import API

Use the connector endpoints below to import warehouses and stock rows:

```text
POST /api/connector/stock-locations/import/
POST /api/connector/stocks/import/
```

Authentication uses a user API key in the `Authorization` header:

```text
Authorization: Api-Key <your-api-key>
```

You can generate the key from the signed-in account area in the `API Keys` section.

### 1. Import stock locations

Use this endpoint to create or update warehouses / stock locations.

```json
[
	{
		"external_id": "ERP-WH-001",
		"name": "Main warehouse"
	},
	{
		"external_id": "ERP-WH-002",
		"name": "Outlet warehouse"
	}
]
```

### 2. Import stock rows

Use this endpoint to import stock per product and warehouse.

```json
[
	{
		"external_id": "ERP-STOCK-001",
		"product_external_id": "ERP-PROD-001",
		"stock_level_external_id": "ERP-WH-001",
		"quantity": 25
	},
	{
		"external_id": "ERP-STOCK-002",
		"product_external_id": "ERP-PROD-001",
		"stock_level_external_id": "ERP-WH-002",
		"quantity": 4
	},
	{
		"external_id": "ERP-STOCK-003",
		"product_external_id": "ERP-PROD-002",
		"stock_level_external_id": "ERP-WH-001",
		"quantity": 0
	}
]
```

Example request for stock locations:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/connector/stock-locations/import/ \
	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-H "Authorization: Api-Key <your-api-key>" \
	-d '[
		{
			"external_id": "ERP-WH-001",
			"name": "Main warehouse"
		},
		{
			"external_id": "ERP-WH-002",
			"name": "Outlet warehouse"
		}
	]'
```

Example request for stocks:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/connector/stocks/import/ \
	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-H "Authorization: Api-Key <your-api-key>" \
	-d '[
		{
			"external_id": "ERP-STOCK-001",
			"product_external_id": "ERP-PROD-001",
			"stock_level_external_id": "ERP-WH-001",
			"quantity": 25
		},
		{
			"external_id": "ERP-STOCK-002",
			"product_external_id": "ERP-PROD-001",
			"stock_level_external_id": "ERP-WH-002",
			"quantity": 4
		},
		{
			"external_id": "ERP-STOCK-003",
			"product_external_id": "ERP-PROD-002",
			"stock_level_external_id": "ERP-WH-001",
			"quantity": 0
		}
	]'
```

### Notes

- Send `stock-locations/import/` when you want to add new warehouses or update their names.
- Send `stocks/import/` to update stock rows for products in warehouses.
- `quantity` is the final stock value, not a delta.
- `quantity = 0` is allowed.
- `stocks/import/` works with existing product and warehouse mappings.
- On success, both endpoints return `201 Created` with an empty body.
